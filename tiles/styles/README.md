# Open Zoomstack Styles

This is based upon the official Zoomstack styles which can be downloaded from [https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/OS-Open-Zoomstack-Stylesheets/tree/master/Vector%20Tiles/Mapbox%20GL%20Styles](here) with a few small modifications:

- Mapbox dependency and metadata have been removed
- References to "Arial Unicode MS Regular" have been removed as these are not present in the fonts folder supplied
- Sprites files have been renamed to sprite.xxx as this is what the mapboxjs-gl client is expecting
